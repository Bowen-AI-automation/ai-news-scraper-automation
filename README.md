# ai-news-scraper-automation
Built an end-to-end Python automation pipeline that pulls top tech stories via Playwright, transforms headlines into concise Chinese using an LLM API, and delivers results as CSV + optional HTML email (SMTP). Includes .env-based config, logging/error handling, and setup docs for repeatable daily runs.
